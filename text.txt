23Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
34And sorry I could not travel both
45And be one traveler, long I stood
56And looked down one as far as I could
78To where it bent in the undergrowth.

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.
